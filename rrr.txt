Developer create code----> server Git ----> automatically download-----> set of files
converted----->install testing severs ----> create programs -----> jenkins
automatically exsicute -----> testing sucessfull finally delivery to client

This Entire follow we call it has ci - cd 

2006 jenkins is called as hadson

why its serves as of now easy plugin and integrates any software conpatibility
jenkins community also update every time
This tool only for then 15 years use cotinues integration
jenkins editions comes both 

1. community edition ( free every one)
2. Enterprise edition ( orgnisation its gives support to any issues)

=========================================================================
Installations 
======================
we are required to install some softweres 

3 server we are creating use ubantu linux
first serve---> we need install java because jenkins depends on java not there we
can't run jenkins similerly we requires two other software GIT and Maven then install
on jenkins

2nd server---> install Tomcat9, Tomcat9 admin ( Tomcat menas Application sever)

3rd server---> install Tomcat9, Tomcat9 admin ( Tomcat menas Application sever)

create sever after how do connect the severs ..?
linux server as a command prompt is call as a terminal every linux will have command
prompt though where you to execute the commands thus commanly call as terminal.

To that linux severs iam install another software GIT 

Going to google type GIT download----> windows--->after download set of file
to install click
next and next----> GIT is install----> you get GIT bash

GIT Bash is the command Prompt terget where we will be firing GIT commands.

==========================================================================
Use this GIT Bash to connect linux severs which are running on aws cloud  
===========================================================================
my personal computer is windows mechine where as we created 3 linuxs mechines on
aws cloud now i want to connect those linux mechines how will connect this git 
is working like a interface
===============
First senario
===============
first we do is -----> Go to Git bash and type-----> cd downloads (there is security
key in the download )
Then identify which sever you want connect..? 
i want to connect jenkins server then highlight the jenkins sever click on 

------> "connect" ----->SSH Client---->copy example ssh command and paste that ssh
command in your GIT Bash------> enter (are you sure you wnat to continue connecting 
we will give "yes")

then command prompt change------> some ip address  ex:ubuntu@ip-172-31-35-155:~$
then type exit-----> logout

(EC2 Instance closed come to your window mechine.)
=================
One More senario
==================
now iam connect QA server repeat same steps to highlight QA server then click
connect ----> ssh client----> copy ssh command example
Then paste Git bash------>give confirmation-----> yes----> connection Established.
then exit.

==================================================================================
jenkins server-1 ---->cd downloads---->jenkins connect -----> ssh command example---->paste Git
bash---->enter
then----> sudo apt-get update
--------> sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk  (java installization)
--------> java -version  (check version)
intall Maven----->command after ip address---->sudo apt-get install -y git maven
enter press
lets check version------> git --version
then check version maven------>mvn --version
next install jenkins:
-----> Go to Google type jenkins download
select stable release
-----> i want its download the ubuntu sever which run on the aws cloud that ubuntu
sever doen't have graphical interface we can't open borrower do all this things
----->right click and copy generic java Package link address
-----> wget paste link here (wget is download command)
lets check its download or not use command ls (list of files)
jenkins.war (downloaded)
how to start jenkins command----> java -jar jenkins.war (enter)

now check jenkins server in browser ----> every server have public ip and private
ip in network section-----> Give copied public ip in the browser :8080 is the port
number
unlock jenkins copy the password in git bash and paste here and continue
its showing two options select install suggested plugins.
next create first admin user,password,full name,email adress final give sava and
continue
jenkins is ready to use.

(here its downloaded: jdk Git maven jenkins)

====================================================================================
install Tomcat9 QAServer-2 cd downlods----->highlight and connect QAServer---->
ssh command ex copy-----> paste GIT Bash press enter------> update apt repository
use command ---->sudo apt-get update----> then install Tomcat9 use command ----->
sudo apt-get install -y tomcat9
Then install tomcat9 admin------> Command sudo apt-get install -y tomcat9-admin
done once tomcat installed if you go into /etc/tomcat9/ folders you people will find 
there file tomcat user as tomcat user.xml lets show it

cd/etc/tomcat9/------>ls----->First you can modify-------> sudo vim tomcat-user.xml
                                                (vim is edit command in linux)

what ever is content is there you remove entire content and give replacement the
content press (esc or i )

<tomcat-user>
            <user username="anilkumar" password="anilkumar" roles="manager-script"/>
</tomcat-user>

press shift+:wq

once it done you can restart tomcat service command-----> 
                                           sudo service tomcat9 restart (press enter)

tomcat also web application like similer to jenkins 

tomcat9 sucessfully installed QA SERVER now connect ----> network-----> take public 
ip adress and paste to browser and give with prot number :8080

exit QAServer
==================================================================================

Prodserver-3 cd downloads----->connect prodserver----->ssh ex------>paste ---->
git bash----->update apt----->sudo apt-get update----->install tomcat9------>
sudo apt-get install -y tomcat9------->install tomcat9 admin----> sudo apt-get
install -y tomcat-admin------>cd/etc/tomcat9/----->ls----->sudo vim tomcat-user.xml
remove content-----> and replace new content

<tomcat-user>
            <user username="anilkumar" password="anilkumar" roles="manager-script"/>
</tomcat-user>

press shift+:wq
sudo service tomcat9 restart

check in brower it work or not take public id and brower with :8080

==================================================================================

cd downloads--->ssh----->yes----->ls----->jenkins.war----->java -jar jenkins.war 

jenkins sever is on the running condition

highlight the jenkins sever and networking section take public ip and paste in
brower with :8080 open dish board of jenkins

Developer after creating code and pushing that code in git repository they will
provide url where our work start

jenkins teminology this stages are called as jobs

creating jobs:

jenkins ------> new items------>enter an item name project ex:Develpment------>select ---->
freestyle projects------>click on ok

---->source code Management----->select git----->repository URL paste here
now click on apply and save----->dashboard and the firtst stage of ci cd is done

after that creating job right side one build icon is there click on that icon 
your job is executed. (refresh)

display in sucess status if click on the number on left hand pannel you will find 
console output. console output is the location where the logs of jenkins generated

(in interview asking where do the logs of jenkins answer:console output)

click on console output----->what happen here its cloning the git repository
finally its showing msg sucess which means the first stage of ci cd is sucessfully
where its download Building in workspace 

lets connect jenkins server----> ssh-----> cd downloads---->cd building workspace
path paste it here after doing that give ls shows dirctories or files

first stage continues download is done

maven is build tool of java maven there are 7 stages of life cycle though which
performaning this activity at this point of time no need all that the 5th stage of 
maven is called as package this is stage where maven converts your code into a 
artifact.

lets go back into jenkins ---->dash board---->click on development downword arrow
----->configure -----> arlear move same page ----->build steps----->add build steps
---->invoke top level maven targets ------>and package----->click on apply and save
click on build icon

click on console output----->what happen here its cloning the git repository
finally its showing msg sucess which means the first stage of ci cd is sucessfully
where its download Building in workspace

cd downloads---->cd building workspace
path paste it here after doing that give ls shows dirctories or files

now completed 2nd stage creating artifact is done
=================================
3rd stage continues deployment
===============================
Team of Devlopers are some code that code convert into the war files (aritifact)that 
war file deploy into a Tomcat application server then we can browse any application 
in internet.

Testing purpose we required one plugin name Deploy to container
how do you install this plugin..?

---->Go to jenkins dashborad----->click on Manage jenkins----->Manage plugins--->
----->available plugins---->now search to deploy to container-----> highlight the
plugin---->click on install without restart---->plugin install 

go back to dash board
 
now go to post build actions ----->add post-build action---->select---->deploy war
/ear to a container when click on it **/*.war----->context path testapp---> click
on add container---->tomcat9 -----> credentials add jenkins--->now you user name
and password after that click on add---->tomcat url give http://private ip with :8080

back to dash board if i run 3rd time click build icon

Notify : downloading the code building the code and deploy the code into the testing
server tomcat also treegred.

as of we discuss what is the content path you given public ip with testapp
application should be run on browser.

=================================================================================
4th continues Testing
================================================================================
go back to dash board-----> new item---->Enter name Testing---->freestyle project

(Tesing team creating some selinum programs they uploading to git. after upload code
testers will given an url this code we uploading)

source code Managment----->git ---->copy and past url ----> save this job
